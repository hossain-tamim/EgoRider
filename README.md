Road safety is a critical concern in countries with high traffic density and complex urban infrastructure, such as Bangladesh. This research proposes the creation of an egocentric bike video dataset captured from helmet-mounted cameras, with the aim of developing machine learning models for risk and accident anticipation and action recognition. The dataset will include diverse riding scenarios covering urban and rural roads, varying traffic conditions, and different times of day, annotated for frame-level risk, object presence, and rider actions. We plan to establish a structured benchmark dataset to enable reproducible research and fair comparison of models. Using this dataset, baseline models for frame-level risk classification and object detection will be developed and evaluated. The expected outcomes are: (1) a publicly available dataset for the research community, (2) baseline models for accident risk prediction, and (3) insights into rider behavior in challenging traffic environments. This study aims to provide both practical tools for autonomous risk monitoring and a foundation for future research in egocentric traffic scene understanding.
