# EgoRider: Egocentric Video Analysis for Biker Safety

EgoRider is a research project focused on analyzing egocentric (first-person) video data from bikers. The project aims to develop a pipeline for video analysis, literature synthesis, and systematic review of biker behavior and safety.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Literature Review

The core of our research starts with the `Literature_Review` folder.

- Consult the `EgoCentric_Biker_Paper_Log.xlsx` to see the current taxonomy of papers.
- New papers should be added to the log following the existing column format (Title, Link, Method, Key Findings, and How it can help to our work).

### 2. Presentation Materials

All presentation-related materials are stored in the `presentation` directory.

- **Date-Specific Folders:** Each presentation has its own folder named by date (e.g., `Date_DD-MM-YYYY`).
- **README:** The `README.md` in this folder contains the schedule and topics for upcoming presentations.

### 3. Review Paper Development

The `review_paper` folder contains the information and drafts related to our systematic review paper.

- **Drafts:** All manuscript versions are stored in the `drafts` sub-folder.
- **Paper Logs:** Notes and summaries of individual papers are kept in the `paper_logs` sub-folder.
- **Pipeline Design:** Diagrams and logical flowcharts for our research methodology are located in the `pipeline_design` sub-folder.

### 4. Video Analysis & Teamwork

The `video_analysis` folder is dedicated to team-specific pilot studies.

- Each team has its own sub-folder (e.g., `Team_Adnan-Aysha`, `Team_Ruhul-Saikat-Afifa`, `Team-7th-Semester`).

## 🛠 Guidelines for Contributors

- **File Naming:** Use `Snake_Case` for all files and directories as shown in the structure.
- **Updates:** When updating a presentation, create a new date-stamped folder under `presentation/`.
- **Documentation:** Keep logs and notes updated in their respective folders to ensure clarity and continuity as well as update this README as necessary.
- **Collaboration:** Use branches and pull requests for major changes to ensure code review and discussion.
